        % Function: connect
        %
        % This method connects the computer with the AOTF for a given 
        % com port.
        %
        % Inputs: obj - The instance of the class. This argument is
        %           suppressed if called FROM the instance.
        %         comPort - A string which matches the virtual com port
        %           assigned to the device by windows.
        % Outputs: obj - The instance of the class. Used to update
        %            instance properties.
        %          aotfSerialObj - The AOTF object used to communicate with
        %            the actual console via Matlab's serial api.
